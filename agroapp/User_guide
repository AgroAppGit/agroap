This is a compilation of notes on how to use this ruby on rails webserver and databases.
Specifically for Agro Engineering.

Adding a new client.
	Create client login and password via the site.
	Create a folder in /public/ with their farm_name as the title of the folder.
	Place a blank document called "tracer" in it so github tracks this folder.
	Everything else should track along with their farm name.

Posting a note to everyone
	Log in as agro
	Go to post a note
	Post note under the farm "allgrowers"
	whatever is written will be posted to everyone.
